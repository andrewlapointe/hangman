          This project served both as a way to learn JavaScript and as an
          exploration in web development as a whole. I am still new as a
          programmer and am unsure of what I would like to specialize in. I have
          taken a simple HTML/CSS class which I enjoyed and I wanted to delve a
          little deeper into the front end side of computer science.

          This web application is a recreation of the popular online game
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>
          by the New York times. The object of the game is to guess a five
          letter word in six guesses or less. After each guess the game will
          prompt the player with hints.
          <br />
          <br />
          A <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold"> green</span> square
          means that the letter is in the right place.
          <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold"> Yellow</span>
          indicates that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place. If a
          square is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> red</span>, the
          letter isn't anywhere in the word.
